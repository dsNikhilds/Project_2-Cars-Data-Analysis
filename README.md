Dataset Exploration with Cars data

by Nikhil

Data source : Cars Data : https://www.kaggle.com/vikrantkc/cars-dataset

This data set includes information about the Cr's make, model, origin, price etc.

Data structure: This is a relatively small dataset. This csv file include 10 rows and 15 coloumns.

In my opinion the following questions are the most important question in the data set.
  1. What are the different types of Make present in the dataset and, what is the count (occurrence) of each Make in the data ?
  2. Show cars of weight more than 4000 units.
  3. Show information of about cars made in specific regions.
